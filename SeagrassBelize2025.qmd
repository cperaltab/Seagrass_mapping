Time frame: 2025???


Workflow

1.- Groundtruth database creation: data points taken from Claudias visit to Belize, GPS data recording and bothom type identification. Additional seagrass data points from 
SegrassNet site. No seagrass occurrence data in OBIS. Scleractinia data points taken from OBIS. Imported all data points (104 in total) to GoogleEarth Pro and check accuracy of points and benthic habitat verification; used seagrass, sand and hardbottom type (including Scleractinia). Scleractinia data are very poor and not enough for a significant class.

Looking for different satellite images dates in Google Earth Pro to get the better image (no clouds, no turbidity, good resolution); some points were on top of mangroves, some other points were hard to confirm the type of habitat it was representing. No celar view of the bottom. Market in green the verified points which will be used after for the training points (featureCollection in GEE). The data points available are from Bacalar Chico down to Punta Gorda (inland)
